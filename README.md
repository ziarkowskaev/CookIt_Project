> CookIt is the social media app for food lovers! This app was developed for the Design of WWW Services course at Aalto University.
The project is structured as a monorepo, with frontend and backend functionality stored in their respective directories. 

### ‚ú® [Demo](https://cookit-frontend.onrender.com/)

## Frontend Install

```sh
cd ./frontend && npm install
```

## Backend Install
```sh
cd ./backend && npm install
```

## Start Frontend or Backend Locally
```sh
npm run dev
```

#### In order to run the frontend, you need to create a .env file in its root directory (./frontend/) with the following environment variables:

```
VITE_SERVER_ADDRESS <url for backend>
```

#### Similarly, the backend requires the following environment variables:

```
MONGODB_URI <uri connection string for a MongoDB database>
JWT_SECRET <some secret string>
SERVER_PORT <default is 4000>
SERVER_HOST <probably localhost>
```
